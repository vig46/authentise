# Explanation of the code
The code is written in Java and uses Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. The code launches the Chrome browser, navigates to Calculator.net Conversion Calculator website, performs two tests (temperature and weight conversion), and closes the browser. The code uses xpath, CSS selector and other Selenium locators to locate the elements and interact with the website(https://www.calculator.net/conversion-calculator.html). The code also contains assertions to verify the results of the conversions.
